        <div class="how_section">
            <p class="tool_explanations">Start by creating three large sections of the chart. The first will be the question or problem section in which you list out the questions you are trying to address. It helps to list questions of varying complexity, from anything as complex as “How do we align this project with our organization’s goals” to something as simple as “What should we set our expected metrics to." The second section will contain the answers to each question.</p>
            <p class="tool_explanations">Brainstorm the ideas you have to address each question, and feel free to come up with multiple answers for each one. A good answer to the example question, “How do we align this project with our organization’s goals”, can be something like “We will ask for feedback from our organization to evaluate whether the project’s desired result aligns with the larger goals”. Finally, when you have created your questions and answers, use the third section to evaluate each answer you have brainstormed. In essence, you define success in these three steps by defining what you need to be successful in, what to do to be successful, and how successful the methods are.</p>
